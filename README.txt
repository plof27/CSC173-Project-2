GenPrint.h is some code I stole from the internet which will allow for printing of variables without knowing their type beforehand
I got it from [here](http://www.robertgamble.net/2012/01/c11-generic-selections.html). Just include the file and you can use the methods print() and println() to print single variables without knowing their type.
I don't really know how it works, but it has something to do with generic function selection and macros. (Concatination is not supported.)
