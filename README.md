This readme is for us. (Not to be turned in to TAs.)

##Git and Github
If you've never used github before, there is a (somewhat lengthy, and probably not necessary) tutorial [here](http://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners). Additionally, there is are several desktop clients which make everything much easier. The official one is [here](https://desktop.github.com/) but there are [others](https://git-scm.com/download/gui/linux).

##GenPrint
GenPrint.h is some code I stole from the internet which will allow for printing of variables without knowing their type beforehand. I got it from [here](http://www.robertgamble.net/2012/01/c11-generic-selections.html). It has some trouble with pointers, but I can fix those errors as they arise. Just include the file and you can use the methods print() and println() to print a single variable without knowing its type  (Concatination is not supported.) I don't really know how it works, but it has something to do with generic function selection and macros.
